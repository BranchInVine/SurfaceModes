**Title of our paper:** _A versatile solver of the normal modes for horizontal stratified complicated models_

__Description:__

The code package, called **SurfaceModes**, aims to compute the normal modes (i.e. the phase velocities and the corresponding displacement-traction vectors at frequencies of interest) for diverse horizontal layered models (e.g., solid, fluid, fluid-solid, solid-fluid, solid-fluid-solid).

The codes are written in Fortran 90 language and compiled on Windows platform using Intel Fortran compiler. Users are suggested to install an Intel Fortran compiler before running the code.
